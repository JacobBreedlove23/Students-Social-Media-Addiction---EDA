# README: Students' Social Media Addiction & Its Impact on Academics

This notebook explores the relationship between students' social media usage patterns and their academic well-being. Through a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and multivariate techniques, we aim to understand how screen time, addiction levels, and social media conflicts relate to mental health, sleep, and academic performance.
